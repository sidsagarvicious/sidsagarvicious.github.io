# first post

Flag 1: Robots

The first one was a nice easy find as a result of some basic enumeration.

Looking in /robots.txt, I immediately spotted the flag:
	

User-agent: *
Disallow: /s3cr3t-ar3a
Flag: flag{48104912-28b0-494a-9995-a203d1e261e7}

Thanks very much to those who put the challenge together, I had a great time and learned a few new tricks! Also, I hate you just a little bit for flag 11. <3.
